# Histogram-Equalization-and-Matching
This project is very much a work in progress, but the overall idea is to design an "AI" (if you want to call it that) to play a game of Azul, which is a board game. The idea is that the learning model will use a neural network built and trained on simple constrain training methods. Because of this, there will be various versions of the Azul game in this respository. The are all in the "Azul" directory and they are in various "Stages" which will need to be run sequentially to teach the model different things. For example, the first version of Azul which has been uploaded will teach the AI that filling harder to fill rows quickly is good, putting blocks into the overflow is bad, and that placing blocks in general is good. All things pertaining to the AI itself will be in a separate folder called "AI" and will be uploaded as I find time to work on it.
